This report has been updated to account for the sudden BTC pump to $121,600 on Monday morning, August 11, likely driven by positive CPI data or market anticipation, shifting probabilities toward more bullish outcomes. ETH and SOL prices have been adjusted proportionally to ~$3,900 and ~$195, respectively.)*

## Executive Summary

Following a sudden pump in BTC to $121,600 on Monday morning (August 11), the week's outlook has turned more bullish for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL), with a 75% combined probability of upside or neutral scenarios. This surge aligns with dovish Fed expectations (78% chance of September rate cut), strong ETF inflows, and potentially favorable CPI data. Key risks remain, such as unemployment spikes or China data weakness, but the pump reduces downside odds. Expected end-of-week prices (from current levels): BTC ~$124,500 (+2.4% from $121,600), ETH ~$4,010 (+2.8% from $3,900), SOL ~$202 (+3.6% from $195). Traders should monitor US unemployment (Aug 15) and China data, maintaining positions with tightened stop-losses amid increased volatility.
