With a long/short ratio of 3.03, there is significant bullish pressure, as many are betting on price increases. Liquidations are predominantly long, which could lead to further upward momentum if the price holds.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Key risks for position holders:\n- **High Long Exposure**: A long/short ratio of 3.03 indicates over-leverage in long positions, which could trigger a sharp correction if sentiment shifts.\n- **Funding Rate Volatility**: The negative funding rate may indicate potential profit-taking by shorts, leading to increased volatility.\n- **Liquidation Risk**: With 13,601 long liquidations in the last hour, a sudden price drop could exacerbate selling pressure.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Actionable insight: Consider taking partial profits or setting stop-loss orders to protect your gains, especially if the price approaches key resistance levels.
