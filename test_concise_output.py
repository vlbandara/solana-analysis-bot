🎯 BIAS: UNCLEAR – The data present a genuine tug-of-war: spot is grinding higher (+3% 24h) yet perpetual funding is materially negative (-0.21%, headed to -0.37%). The account-based Long/Short ratio is still very long at 3.0, but it has fallen almost 14% in 24h, implying longs are being reduced while large-sized shorts (fewer accounts, bigger notional) keep funding negative. Open-interest has barely budged (+0.55%), so neither side has yet committed meaningful fresh capital...
